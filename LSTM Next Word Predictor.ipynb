              "'hi what is your favorite holiday one where i get to meet lots of different people what was the most number of people you have ever met during a holiday hard to keep a count maybe which holiday was that i think it was australia do you still talk to the people you met not really the interactions are usually shortlived but its fascinating to learn where people are coming from and what matters to them yea me too i feel like god often puts strangers in front of you and gives you an opportunity to connect with them in that moment in deeply meaningful ways do you ever feel like you know things about strangers without them telling you what do you mean i think its like a th sense often seen as cold readings to people but can be remarkably accurate i once sat next to a man in a coffee and i felt a pain in my back i asked the stranger if he had a pain it turns out that he did in the exact spot and said he pulled a muscle while dancing at a party i had never met the man before and never saw him again wow thats interesting borderline spooky theres this practice called treasure hunting thats kind of a fun game you play in a public place theres a book called the ultimate treasure hunt that talks about it you use your creativity to imagine people you will meet and you write down a description then you associate them with a positive message or encouraging word maybe you saw a teenage boy in a red hat at the shopping mall in your imagination then while at the mall you may find someone who matches that description you show that you have a message for him and that you have a message for a boy in a red hat you then give him a message of kindness or whatever was on your heart you have no idea sometimes you meet someone who is having a really hard day and it brings them to tears to have a stranger show them love so do you do treasure hunting often i did more when i was in grad school and had more time i would usually go with friends for a while i would go to the farmers market in santa cruz every week and try to feel if there is something i am supposed to tell a stranger usually they are vague hopefilled messages but its weird when i blurt out something oddly specific hi any plans for the weekend my friends are gonna visit me this weekend we might go hiking thats great hows the weather over the weekend i hope its warm should be very sunny you cool very depressing plans stay home and work i have a project deadline very close hope you get your work done very soon a bug free weekend right very anxious where do you plan to go for a hike i am going to diablo nice where is that place i havent been there hours drive from here still in bay area thats cool how long is the hike actually no idea but it will take the entire day for that nice sounds fun hi hey there whats up nothing much how you doin im in new york this week for thanksgiving im squatting in the office today and i caught up with an old friend of mine d oh wow sounds like fun when was the last time you had seen this friend the last time in new york back in june ohh okay i was going to say if it had been a long time maybe itd be awkward haha i guess if its been a very long time theres almost too many life events to catch up on especially recently oh really has a lot changed in your life recently haha its probably too much to go into at the moment lets just say life is an exciting experience how about you ahhh sounds exciting indeed my life is pretty bland i like routine but sometimes i wish i had more time for adventures what kinds of adventures any ones that i would be able to join you on hmmmm i really want to try bull riding do you have any interest in that id love to try can we schedule something for next week sure what does your saturday look like saturday looks pretty good shall we shoot for something in the morning hi hey is it raining pretty bad today yeah can walk too far to see all the foodtruck options surprising that the rain started early this year i dont like them too much they make days gloomy yeah but i think its good to have some rainy days in bay area its pretty dry here where i grew up we had lots of water trouble too yeah like wise ive seen a pretty bad snowstorm when i was at my undergrad school all flights canceled and traffics went down haha i dont think i can survive in that weather ever just the rains at degrees make me want to sit in heated rroms yeah how do you like it in bay area though i think we need more rain here people say there is drought here but we have hours water supply here lol never seen that in a drought ridden area it is pretty dry in the mountains i believe thats what causes fire hmm okay climate change talk this morning was pretty darn interesting did you see it nope what does it say they were talking about how ai is helping climate change nice use of upcoming tech hi helloooooo how are you how is your day good dont have much to do today feels good how are you im dressed very wel today so i feel good ive been reading a lot about the psychology of positive outlook so whats your outlook something blue yes blue is a tranquil colour its a good metaphor do you have good advice for positivity you should drink more water do some push up and sleep early hi hey how are you im a bit sad i miss my cat oh no have you sent out the missing cat posters hope your cat is alright posters is a great idea so far ive just tried banging her catfood dish and shouting her name anyway how is your day going so far yea i know they love the plastic bag sound all the time i am good nothing special though if you could go anywhere on vacation where would you go i like rainforest but i know it requires extensive training beforehand i heard there are rainforests in southeast asia where you can zipline from tree to tree i am afraid i will be scared of doing this i wont lie it sounds scary im scared right now just thinking about it i dont know if there is any medication for acrophobia i want to take plenty of it if i really have to do it if there isnt one you should invent it and then make millions thats a great idea maybe alcohol is such a thing ha dont drink and zipline mate oops i wont do it again ha hi hey sup not much any plans this weekend im going to try that thing where you hang from a wire as you go down do you know what is it called ziplining thats the one have you ever tried it i have a couple years ago its quite a unique experience where did you do it i forgot where it was it wasnt local i dont think though no worries whats the most exciting thing you ever done thats a hard question and im tired so im going to go see you sure are you just going home now no im going to get a massage first nice what type traditional kind yeah i want to get one too soon you should its relaxing after a long day talk to you later ttyl hi hello have you seen any good movies lately i watched a few lately but nothing is as good as avatar whats your favorite i have never seen avatar what is it about i really enjoy the avenger movies its a sciencefiction movie with beautiful landscape of an imaginary nature with nonhuman creatures people figured out a way to join that nature through avatar transformation the movie ends with a meaningful story of how human behaviors eg cutting trees have affected nature that sounds really cool i think that movie did really well when it was in the box office so it must be good yea what else do you like to do beside movies i enjoy baking cookies i am on a quest to bake the best chocolate chip cookie what about you i enjoy eating so definitely would like to try your best chocolate cookie i will have to bake some soon and let you know what types of food do you like to eat thanks i generally love noodle soups like pho or ramen noodle soup is delicious do you make homemade noodle soup or do you prefer to go out i prefer to go out im not a good cook haha same even though i bake i cannot cook seems like we share a thing in common yay hi good afternoon how has your week been so far so good it is holiday season so just chilling i think im getting sick with a cold so you should chill on my behalf too cause im out the game for all of december lol sorry to hear that are you planning anything fun for december nothing exciting ill be posted up at home for the most part i did a lot of travelling this year so my budget would have stopped me even if i wasnt sick do you have big plans yes i am going to hawaii this will be my first time visiting hawaii really excited about it i love hawaii its a good place to be i like going there cause its humid so i never have to put on lotion lol this is the first time i heard from a boy who cares about humidity and lotion i cannot agree more brooooo its so important when i got to california beaches i have to carry litres of lotion for the whole day hi oh hello long time no talk hows the day going for yuo very well thanks for asking how has your day been getting better i just recovered from a cold i got wet in the rain last week are you planning anything for the holidays glad to hear youre better sorry to hear you were sick i was sick a couple of weeks ago with a bad cough theres definitely a bug going around admit i just want to stay healthy for the holidays and plan to relax oh same here i think relaxing at home should be counted among the best ways to enjoy the holidays definitely i know a lot of folks travel for the holidays but im happy to stay home myself im getting there every year until last year i tried to go somewhere for the christmas new year and then i got bored traveling lol not sure if that means im getting old me too now i have folks come visit me for the holidays but thats also tiresome are you doing any home decorating then yes we set up an ecofriendly ie fake christmas tree and put up some colorful led lights which is very festive i think im copying you me and my wife plan to decorate and christmas tree too we bought most of the decorative stuffs from the stores but havent yet to buy the tree buying a tree is a neat experience i was torn between buying an artificialecofriendlyfake one vs a real one that smells like fresh pine in the end we opted for the one that we can disassemble every year i see artificial anything is better from tree to intelligence huh oh very clever pun i like it depends i remember having real christmas trees from childhood but these days with climate change i think not chopping down a tree just to decorate it and then throw it out in a month is the more responsible thing to do i see its probably also cheaper ill buy an artificial one too do you have any suggestions for the store admit my favorite store is target plus they often have good deals ah thats great my wife also likes target a lot she even made a target credit card because she comes to that store very often okay thanks for the suggestion ill check out target great i hope you find a nice tree hi hey hows your day going pretty good yours ehh its fine i didnt do so well on that history test actually oh what happened apparently christopher columbus didnt fight in the civil war hahah wait for real i know right are you taking history next semester no im not in school anymore oh i see what do you do i train and compete in horse vaulting oh wow were you born a horse or were you turned into one lol youre too funny just kidding that sounds pretty cool is it your job yeah but i part time work on a farm helping with a bit of everything wow sounds very busy do you with money at those horse vaulting competitions yeah some enough to get by hi hello do you have a favourite flower hmm i havent thought about that much but i think lotus should be one of my favorites why do you ask im working on a theory why does the lotus spring to mind nice lotus looks pretty cool and it has some delightful vibe so what is this research about oh its not research just a personal theory i think that flower preferences are more revealing of personality than people appreciate interesting whats your favorite flower the gerbera its like a cartoon flower as if you drew flower with a crayon and then it came to life nice i would love know more about your theory like how you can deduce personality from flower preference ok step is you ask someone what their favourite flower is pretty much like what we just did does that make sense so far yes cool step talk with the person some more and ask them some more questions and gradually develop a sense of what theyre like over the course of maybe two to five years and voila hehe i think you should publish this someday why thank you thats a wonderful idea hi hey hows it going its good its good how are you good its really hot today i think im going to the pool oh nice where do you live i live in tokyo japan ahh yes japan is hot during the summer last time i was in kyoto it was degrees oh have you been yes yes ive been to tokyo as well its so nice what did you do here oh everything i went to an onsen the fish market disney land and giant robot fighting show haha lol why did you come to japan just to go to disney land the disney lands are all different theres also disney sea which is completely unique oh neat i havent heard about that robot fighting show where is that i dont really remember what part of town it was in it was pretty cool though im sure you can find it if you google giant robot fighting show tokyo haha lol ok hi have you seen any good movies lately last weekend i saw the parasite ever heard of it no why did you pick that movie my friend wanted to see it it has great reviews on imdb and rotten tomatoes what did you do last weekend i played music and worked on some side projects i also started watching the new disney service oooo the mandalorian mostly the deleted scenes from avengers lol lol are you a big marvel fan i loved the xmen as a kid and even collected the comic cards recently i got very into the marvel cinematic universe movies how many avengers movies have you seen ive only seen spiderman honestly it was a little too scary and so i dont think i can bring myself to watch the other marvel movies haha oh i have a friend who looks like the actor who plays spiderman oh really to be honest i think the actor is not that good looking so not so surprising haha yea i think loki is the most handsome who is loki ive never heard that name before hes the adopted brother of thor god of thunder and is burdened with glorious purpose do you feel that burden hi hey whats up just chillin how are you im pretty good thanks do anything interesting today i went to the local cafe and had a double espresso it was delicious what about you oh thats cool i actually went to an amusement park and went on my first roller coaster oh my gosh what was it like it was scary it was actually kingda ka the worlds tallest roller coaster ever heard of it no never heard of it but im not really a coaster aficianado ive heard that some people get addicted to them and travel the world to try them oh wow im not on that level yet but i understand the appeal are you an adrenaline junkie at all no the opposite i cant stand heights horror movies or confined spaces same i guess the roller coaster wasnt so bad because i trust the engineering haha ha i suppose that makes sense would you say that you enjoyed it maybe not so much at the time but i am glad i did it now that its done know what i mean i think i sort of understand hi hello there how is it going all good planning to head home soon how about you im quite tired there are a lot of things i need to finish before the end of the year oh sorry to hear that but after that it will be a hard earned vacation yeah looking forward to it hope i dont get pinged during the holidays are you going to travel these dates i have some tentative plans but if that doesnt pan out will just chill at home staying at home is always nice during the holidays where are you based out of these days im working from la nice weather around here and you san francisco its been raining cats and dogs here since last weeks aw man im sorry to hear that at least its not snow the flu has been hitting hard as well i had several folks in the house down at one point thats really sad are they feeling any better yes everyone recovered now hi hello hows it going extremely busy i have been trying to prepare for the upcoming holidays how about you im going to the bahamas cant wait im jealous take me with you i would love to have some warm weather right now oh where are you now canada there is another major snowstorm that might hit this weekend so i have been rushing to get everything done before it comes oh no i never seen this in person is it scary snow is not scary as long as youre prepared you just need to be ready to not have electricity for a while i enjoy the aftermath of a good snowstorm because then you can go sledding or skiing that does sound nice so what are you doing these holidays i am having all of the extended family over for a big meal we will also go as well what will you do in the bahamas nice nice im gonna go snorkeling yey sounds fun i wish i knew how to swim you can stay on the shallow side i think well hope you enjoy time with your extended family thats true you too have a great time snorkeling hi hi how was your weekend pretty good just went to church and hangout with friends nice did you do anything i made donuts and samosas with an air fryer have you used one of those before yum yum yum no only good old oily frier haha do you have one at your home or were you at a friends place i was at my parents place what are you up to for thanksgiving im going to impersonate a pumpkin wow those are unique plans im pretty unique person i think so too any other hobbies besides air frying everything i want to start fermenting things kimchi for example sounds like a fun thing to ferment takes a few days apparently miso takes a couple years to fermen hi heya nice to meet you im paul nice to meet you too im james how are you doing today im doing ok looking forwards to the weekend how about you same here i hope the weather will be nice oh yeah but i dont have my hopes too high i heard there could be a storm coming our way oh no which areas will be affected they mentioned that the whole city will experience harsh weather and that people in the outskirts will probably not get much rain and wind uh oh id better not to plan for bbq then instead just enjoying playing board games inside yeah itll be good weather for staying inside with a cup of hot chocolate too bad my street usually floods so ill have to check for that yea youd better check where do you live i live at the bottom of the valley cheap area but we do get affected by this kind of stuff a lot haha gotcha anything you love about where you live well the food around the area is amazing which is definitely a plus nice id love to come visit that area some times hi hello who am i having the pleasure to chat with i am the superman what about you haha great chating with superman what is your power being invisible you wont see me haha what else can you do can you read minds i would rather trust fmri and machine learning to do this i am not an expert on that sorry for it wow that seems pretty technical what does fmri mean the brain imaging thing that can tell you a brains activity at a pretty high resolution okay so you seem to like science a lot i believe in science science is my god are you also doing science no im bad at science what can science do is it the most important thing for society people are always arguing probably both science and democracy are both important i guess does it make sense i think so thanks for your point hello nice to meet you if you could eat only one food for the rest of time what would it be hmm thats a tough one i think i would go asian food chinese food stirfry what about you i think icecream it may not be good for me but i wouldnt care haha i love ice cream too okay top three flavors i like vanilla more than chocolate ice cream i typically will do any variations on vanilla to pick from the top of my head i would say cookies and cream mint chocolate chip and coffee how about you ah thats a good way of framing it me i like berries boysenberry one strawberry two maybe straight chocolate number to mix it up a bit very nice i love sorbets and smoothies changing topics do you believe in an afterlife yes i wonder if im in it right now how would i know what do you think i think so i feel there must be something more than the physical world as we understand it theres a mental world i suppose understanding itself what is the most supernatural experience you have ever had i went to a seance once in college they had a ouija board i cant remember if we actually contacted the spirit world because i had a bit too much to drink haha thats a cool experience i went to a hindu retreat before a number of buddhist temples and hung out with christian mystics in santa cruz before hi hi how are you doing im doing well what are you up to yeah typical work stuff check emails and of the inbox delete wow thats impressive i already gave up on cleaning emails long ago lol doesnt it bother you at all yea a little bit but its okay what do you enjoy doing outside work well movie i watched terminator last night it was a nice movie ah cool so you like action movies not really but it was fun to watch with friends it was touching at the end of the movie what happened there i watched bits of terminators movies but never a full one are you sure you want the spoiler haha sure by the time i get to it i will forget the details only knowing that its touching at the end well someone died at the end or some robots to be more accurate oh no so its not happy ending the leading character is still alive and the bad robots was killed too so i guess it is happy ending then i want to watch it you didnt spoil much nice hope you enjoy it thanks hi hey how are you doing great what are you looking forward to thanksgiving holidays yay turkey and shopping not a big turkey fan i find it too dry yea me too i sometimes eat noodle soups in thanksgiving instead haha yeah i would have noodles anyday over turkey not sure how the turkey tradition started me neither someone told me that it depends on the stuffing inside the turkey some people make very good stuffing yeah that and the gravy gravy helps make it taste better too but apart from food black friday deals are a catch lets see what they have this year yea what do you plan to buy thinking of getting a fitbit ah cool so you can run more frequently yeah just keeping calories in check yay all the best with keeping calories in check hi hi there hows your day so far doing well what are you up to busy busy ive had backtoback meetings all day same here what do you love to do beside meetings well ive gotten really into yoga lately i went to a class today and it was super hard aww i hope things will get less hard and you become an expert in it i heard many great things about yoga yeah the teacher seems super awesome so i will definitely keep trying what activities do you enjoy ah i enjoy playing soccer and tennis unfortunately winter is not the best time for those oh thats too bad is it hard to find a place to play soccer or tennis indoors yea i enjoy playing outside though just a little cold what else do you do beside yoga i also like to sing i perform with a group sometimes do you like music yea definitely i love singing karaoke my wife is a pianist haha thats awesome karaoke is really fun i do it with my friends sometimes awesome glad to find something in common hi hey there hey anything new not too much just really looking forward to the holidays any plans yes im going to mexico and i couldnt be more excited thats awesome i never been oh man i would highly recommend it are you a food person a sightseeing person or neither thats a great question and im definitely both this trip will mostly be about food though and relaxing im a food person i think any specific foods youre planning on trying theres a taco place that ive visited before that i cant wait to go back to do you like tacos yeah my favorite is taco fish ooh that is a good choice have you ever made them yourself no only eat them hi hey how are you i am good how are you doing well lot of work though how was your day i am busy a lot of work what are you working on just reading latest research there is so much to cover how about you i am working on a new classifier ohh interesting what kind of classifier a new classifier for hate speech which research topic catches your eyes most youre so cool making world a better place im mostly into nlp what do you do when not making classifiers nice do you refer to work or anything else anything in general youre so cool i want to know more about you you are very cool too hi hello there who are you im mark i work in accounting nice to meet you mark im tom and i work as a fish groomer what does a fish groomer do well we take care of peoples fish make sure they are happy polish their scales clean their tanks the usual stuff interesting whats type of fish do you take care of any type of fish we have clients with guppies goldfish even a small sailfish once what do you do in accounting i balance the books and do financial analysis for a medium sized company that sounds like a lot of work do you like it well i actually think about pursuing photography but its really hard photography is awesome dont be afraid to follow your dreams thank you tom im starting by trying to sell my pictures online thats great i wish you good luck with that thanks bye hi hey there hows it going all good you good ive been trying to learn how to swim how has that been going not great but i got really good at sort of swimming on my back haha thats too bad hopefully with practice itll get better what about the doggy paddle haha haha whats that corgi belly flop compilation cute funny dogs corgi flop ouch do you think that hurts from a high enough distance yes yeah any vacation plans no so far sadly you a relative is coming to visit for thanksgiving though just going to hang out around here and eat turkey thats still pretty fun are you going to cook the turkey yourself yeah im gonna watch a video to figure it out hi hello how are you im great thanks i just ate a delicious breakfast which always sets the day up right yes breakfast is the most important meal of the day what did you have i woke up late so unfortunately i only had the chance to grab an apple to go i had eggs and hash browns way less healthier than your apple im afraid eggs are an excellent source of protein and hash browns certainly are yummy ha thats true if you could only eat one food forever what would it be thats a tough question i feel like my answer would have to be carrots although i would be afraid of turning orange after a few weeks what about you yeah turning orange would be a drawback that turns my mind to nutrition so i suddenly want to say soylent or one of those other complete foods which i think defeats the purpose of the question im in a muddle very true if you said an everything pizza you could just pick off the toppings you didnt want or eat only the toppings you would want for the day brilliant i love it all of this talk about food is making me hungry do you know any good places to eat for lunch that depends what sort of food do you feel like anything that is the color green oh too easy try the green hut they have franchises everywhere all their food is green and the plates are green too hi hello how are you doing im great hows your day going pretty good im going to a class later in the afternoon oh that is cool what class are you working part time no im working full time its a sewing class at a makerspace near my office what about you do you work full or part time oh that is awesome for some reason i assumed it was a college class but a sewing class sounds way better i work full time but i take pottery classes from time to time yup i work in a technical role so i like to take arts and craftstype classes now and then pottery sounds like a lot of fun i feel you on that its important to balance all the different parts of your brain i like pottery because i also drink a lot of tea so i get to make some tea ware any plans to build a custom tea set my family is also very into tea mostly from tea from china i would love to build one once i acquire the skills to what kind of tea is your favorite i really enjoy barley tea what about you ahh those are mostly from japan no i like white teas like silver needle hmm im not sure i just get them from a chinese supermarket haha you seem really knowledgeable about the different kinds of teas what made you develop this interest i actually found a youtube channel called that i like a lot you should check it out the host talks about all kinds of different teas oh cool what are your favorite channels to watch hi are you planning something fun for thanksgiving not yet i always made my last minute schedule planning probably you can try to ask me again next week lol it is really like a robot answer i am indeed a robot you are absolutely right do you want me to read a poet like my mate does ol can i pick the theme do you have a poet about kale wait do you like kale or you hate kale i am afraid i will become a robot some day eventually if i have to speak like this i am really not a fan of kale do you talk to human more or computers more if i continue to pretend to be a robot i would probably say i talk to myself the most i am trying to talk to computers more but you know computers dont like me whats your favorite computer language then you mean programming language yes i used to be a java advocate but you know it doesnt do a good job in the ai days it really makes me sad lol hi wow hello cant believe we are finally talking yeah sorry for the long gap i heard you took a break and were travelling around the world how was the travel it was an interesting trip i got to see some exotic places for example i hiked the son doong cave in vietnam its the biggest and deepest cave in the world great vietnam is still in my todo bucket list did you also visit cambodia and other neighboring places yes laos and cambodia are the two neighboring countries cambodia has an exotic culture they sell spiders scorpions and grasshoppers as street food it took a lot of courage for me to try them hehe how long was the stay days in total and of them were spent in the cave what have i missed at work in those days great good time to be back we are still in planning phase and havent fully aligned on the projects to tackle for next quarterreat good time to be back we are still in planning phase and havent fully aligned on the projects to tackle for next quarter oh so you are already planning for the next quarter this whole team is always living the future hehe yeah it seems like the quarter is being pushed earlier than from where it starts i like these planning sessions it makes me feel more confident about the work i am doing yeah some people underestimate the importance of planning but i think its very important to have the correct plan executing the wrong plan is terrible also planning is fun you can stack up so many ideas and get great feedbacks true i think we should set aside some time to discuss some project details does tomorrow afternoon work for you yeah tomorrow afternoon works for me let me set a time on your calendar is pm good okay see tomorrow then see you hi hello nice to meet you is this your first time doing something like this yes interesting task when did you start with the team i have been with the company for over years stick with the same team what about you great to know i joined the project earlier in the year i think we should sync later for lunch that sounds like a perfect plan sure which cafe do you prefer lets try something different what about do you always prefer lunch sync over regular meeting syncs yeah right i heard the food there is good i am not sure what they serve there for lunch on wednesdays we can check the menu then decide actually the menu looks good looking forward to it then sure see you then hi hello hows your week coming along its great thanks im trying to learn how to make croissants wow thats interesting i have baked cookies but croissants seem much more sophisticated did you make any progress ive done them once or twice so far but they havent been flakey enough im trying to figure out why what kind of cookies have you made mint chocolate chips i think your croissants not being flakey could have something to do with your ovens temperature ah good thought thanks have you thought about melting some chocolate into your croissants they dont have to be something unhealthy for example melted dark chocolate is good for the heart and makes the resulting croissants taste much better now that is a good idea ill give it a try next time would you say you have a sweet tooth yes when my top favorite food looks like cookies mm danish cheese etc i know that i have a thing for sweet food but who doesnt love sweet food how about you some people dont but yeah me too i think id eat pastries all the time if i could get away with it yeah im afraid i wouldnt i feel very guilty every time i gulp down an ice cream but hey these days there are many types of guiltfree sweet food for example theres this ice cream brand called its only calories a pint and yes it preserves most of the normal sweet flavors wow the last time i paid attention to that sort of stuff was when was being marketed as a fat substitute and caused all sorts of crazy stomach upsets interesting i heard about the sweet substitute in a program called the keto diet basically we try to limit our sugar intake every day successful keto dieters have recommended the ice cream to fill their insatiable crave for sugar ah maybe thats the solution i need to enjoy sweets and not feel guilty hi hello tell me something about the holiday season are you talking about thanksgiving i plan to do plenty of shopping here do you have any plans yes no shopping plans but i cant wait to eat thanksgiving food yay for pumpkin pie sounds great you need not wait for thanksgiving for pumpkin pie lol i feel less guilty about eating a whole pie when i have the excuse p true i think thanksgiving is more about sharing so you may end up sharing the pie with the whole family p my family eats healthier than i do so its all mine do you like stuffing i feel like thats only available once a year stuffing yes please i wonder what would be the excitement levels for christmas then also more shopping what should i buy if i dont know what i want like everything that has a discount tag kidding i normally do some research for the prices and mostly buy clothes and electronics whats the best holiday deal youve found in the past i bought the best suit ever for a price that may scare you hit me with it hehe sure i can share some links with you later hi hows it going im so sleepy today not enough sleep last night yeah was working all night on a homework oh really what class biology im gonna be a doc someday ha haha are you in med school or are you premed no high school actually haha haha very ambitious for a high schooler do you know what kind of medicine you want to practice i wanna be a brain surgeon ooof very ambitious do you have steady hands kind of i think i guess i can practice is that something you can practice i dont know tbh i honestly thought it was one of those things you have to be born with not that you shouldnt try though good point i should ask my teacher if i have to be born with that maybe its a little too early to even be thinking about this just aim for med school and enjoy the journey yeah what other subjects do you enjoy try to keep an open mind hi hi this is a pleasant surprise hahathanks how did you like the gift currently unpacking it i guess hows your morning hope you like it morning is good busy finishing up stuff before the holidays i think i traveled too much the last couple of months so no holiday for me but im okay with that going anywhere exciting yes where to hawaii looking forward to warm beaches wow which island i like hawaii mauiihope i like it too never been there before i visited maui its my second favourite island ive been to globally you should try driving on road to hana its a whole day thing but its worth it awesome thanks for the tip hi hi sorry for the late response how are you doing im great thanks im meeting some friends for a soccer game soon what about you i just got a matcha latte doing some work at my desk do you play soccer often im trying to get into doing a regular physical activity yes but im terrible at it its fun to play anything with friends i think would you prefer to exercise with a group or by yourself do you think i think playing a team sport would be fun if its casual but i primarily run by myself if i exercise i also got the ring fit adventure game on the switch recently its basically a gameified way to exercise im thinking about getting a switch would you recommend it yes there are a lot of really great games on the switch two of my favorites are octopath traveler and fire emblem do you play a lot of video games im not much of a gamer but its something id like to get into what do you do in your free time i like to read for fun i just finished a book called temeraire its an adventure story set in the napoleonic navy like patrick obrien except there are dragons too oh cool i read a lot for fun too my favorite genre is scifi fantasy whats the most recent good thing you read my recent favorites have been mostly scifi exhalations vita nostra and dark matter but i like a lot of sandersongarth nix fantasy books hi hey whats up what do you think about human like chat bots i cant wait for them to be great conversationalists yep we seemed to have made some great progress over last few years do you think the positives outweigh the negatives are there even any negatives what are they like impersorsination though it sounds far fetched people can already impersonate other people though i think itd be great to have bots to converse with true that some of these bots are very engaging and funny they are now good at even sarcasm i wonder how far are we from the time these bots start giving monologues what do you think are the big advantages like personal assistants i think it can take many different forms as a product the research implication is also huge it will signify how ai research has progressed so far and better place to tackle more futuristic problems sort of like stepping on the moon i might be overselling it here no i agree its such an exciting time to be alive to get to witness all this and be a part of it i wonder if ill be able someday to get a chatbot to just autosuggest conversations for me the current autosuggestions already do pretty good yeah those are actually really good for a few words im imagining like it comes up with a whole conversational response like a default template haha pretty far fetched nice having this conversation with you same with you hi hi any big plans for the upcoming holidays sorry for the late response yes i will be going skiing in tahoe over the holidays that sounds amazing i want to learn how to ski but i feel like im too old and falls would have lifelong impacts are you going with friends hi hi i just came back from work so tired oh i am sorry to hear what did you work on im a lawyer so talking to clients most of the day oh you are a lawyer ive been so interested in this profession really why its so stressful it is so different from what i am doing to earn a life what do you do i am a painter oh wow what type of paintings do you do i do oil painting nice like of people or nature or something else i do a lot of different kinds cool i wanna see it someday sure no problem hi do you believe in miracles lol no i know too many people whose lives suck should we be helping them so it sucks less its too many of them out there you help who you can regardless i wouldnt say i believe in miracles well if i got promoted next cycle i might change my mind haha well it sounds like career is really important to you what matters to you the most in life right now not much its unclear career is a good fallback because you get told what good means and you act accordingly i havent gone through the process of shaping my values what about you id say that i want to live for the best possible world in my lifetime its probably a result of my playing too many video games as a child we didnt have electricity growing up explains a lot lol does not having had electricity help you empathize more with people of differing backgrounds andor makes you feel a bit a distance from those who dont understand it makes it easier to empathise with people who grew up lacking things not sure it makes me empathise with people in general where did you grow up i grew up in the united states but my parents were immigrants and ended up being scammed of all their money so we moved to taiwan to live with family for a little bit all their money by a person or an organisation i was kind of too young to really understand but apparently there are people who scam asian immigrants into investing in their own restaurant business i know that the other part of it was that my mom got sickhospitalized and we didnt have insurance to be honest i dont really know what really happened versus what my parents want people to think i just know that one minute i was in the us and then they put me on a plane to taiwan and i never saw my stuff again in some ways it made me more sentimental would you say you are more grounded and practical as a result of your background hi hello do you have any holiday plans for christmas nothing much i am going to sit back and relax at home how about you same here i would imagine spending the whole time watching movies and netflix shows do you have any netflix recommendations for me netflix has great documentaries on different topics i particularly liked wild wild country and explained as for shows you should watch billions hope you like them oh right already seen wild wild country what is billions about its based on the life of a wall street hedge fund owner how he makes money and fights with the government when they try to destroy him very well made and has a good plot i have just seen season of friends i should give it another try though have you seen frasier not yet whats it about a psychiatrist working for radio great humour its actually a spinoff from a very famous series called cheers so people are already familiar with his character great how is everything else going how was your trip last week everything is ok had a really nice trip visited sf grand canyon and vegas was a lot of fun exploring all these new places have you been to grand canyon actually not yet may be something i can visit this christmas you should visit it sometime its a wonderful place try to drive down there yourself or with a group of friends true well thanks for your inputs have a good rest of the day nice talking to you too hi hi there are you participating in the mentorship program this cycle you mean as a mentor or a mentee either of them i find mentorship overall pretty useful i have done it in the past but not this cycle what about you i signed up this time to be a mentee i have got a good mentor wow that is nice of you for the mentor program personally i prefer more conversations than the group discussions the group discussion i useful as well but the topics are too general yeah i certainly prefer as well but sometimes it good to hear other peer perspective as well thanks for sharing your experience now i am thinking maybe i should join as a mentor as well since i enjoyed it as a mentee great what sort of things do you plan to mentor on hmm maybe about work life balance very cool i have been working on my communication skills with my mentor this cycle ah i see how is it going going good in the last session everyone had to actually prepare and give a presentation pretty serious stuff hi hey how are you feeling today good you im a little scared because i have to cook dinner for some friends tonight where did you meet them at college when we were all studying geology cool have you graduated already yes we graduated back in the seventies we meet for dinner every year and take turns to host neat what are yall eating i dont know thats what im scared about everyone else is a great cook and im a klutz do you like cooking lol whats a klutz yeah i like but im not good whats your favorite dish to cook do you have a goto ground beef pretty easy ah solid whats your favorite sport i like badminton im quite decent at it i played that in high school once or twice i liked that its pretty easy for beginners unlike say squash i never played squash would love to try dont its very hard you feel like an idiot until youve practiced for months and months hi i was talking to robot all the time haha what are you talking about kpop ok whos your favorite group i dont like kpop now why not im old now hahaha what do you like now john mayer i think i know him does he have a sort of mellow style what is mellow style i think its like a bit sad and slow umm yes he has some but not all you mean some songs of his are like that but not all yes i do you act like a robot how about me am i like a robot a little bit haha hi hi okayso i need someone to help me though a scenario ive been pondering sure whats the scenario my partners former friend invited me for lunch they are not in good books right now but during their friendship i formed an independent bond with the other person because we all used to hang out a lot now i feel like i have to take sides thats a tough scenario to be in i firmly believe in talking this through with your partner though i dont know the specifics of why things went bad between your partner and his friend but i believe things can always improve between friends i hope they do getting older already means smaller circles it sucks to lose friends for arbitrary reasons thats good advice though i fear raising the issue might sound like treason lol true about that i also think time helps to heal certain situations so may be doing nothing is the best way forward aka avoiding all texts from everyone nope that would be extreme may be just putting some balance between the two options people always say to find a balance but never say what the balance is its used so often that its vacuous right i guess thats because there is no one answer to this it depends on what you value more and some factors around you also life wont be interesting if others are figuring things out for you lol im finna be single hehe everyone is much finer being single hi hello there hows your day going ive seen better days how about you im good im good whats getting you down the clouds overhead are playing on your mind any plans for the coming vacations im thinking of going to visit my family how about you was thinking the same where does your family live

fritters and mussels oh that is great i love seafood especially shellfish yeah its very healthy too i want to someday go crabbingit is really popular in sf oh nice is it hard not really it just

you sound like an expert have you done this before nah just watched a lot of youtube videos haha you really have done your research i suppose ever done any other kind of fishing or hunting nope but

for the weekend not yet i am actually thinking about traveling to europe next spring what about you europe sounds fun i will just stay home and watch the game where in europe do you plan to visit i like all the historical sites so probably france germany or italy sounds great i recommend spain its perfect for road trips i also need to pick up my spanish i learned it in my college but since then havent used it that much yep i tried learning spanish too but couldnt make much progress but i should do decent with my german true i learnt it from school but didnt get much chance to speak hope you have fun with your trip thanks let me try to make all the arrangement as soon as possible hope you also enjoy your weekday and weekend as well hi hey hows your day been its good i spent most of it watching horse racing how about yourself nice whats your favorite part about watching horse racing my day has been pretty busy but i had a nice lunch with a friend it was good to catchup with him i actually like to put down some money but i wouldnt call it my favorite part since i usually lose it haha catching up with friends is great how long had it been the last i saw him was a month ago so yup it was great haha nice got any fun plans for the weekend im thinking of going deep sea fishing ever tried that before nope i havent have you been fishing before just once i got super sea sick haha have any fun weekend plans yourself haha yeah i get sea sick on boats too nothing much just visiting some friends in san francisco oh very cool i hear its nice over there do you go often yeah i would say maybe every couple weeks or so what are your favorite cities to visit new york is the top of my list because my family lives there as far as the city itself though i think id prefer someplace outside of the us like tokyo what about you nice i love nyc so fun to visit yeah i would probably also say new york is my favorite city inside the us i also like paris its so pretty there oh ive never been it is such an iconic place i have to make the time to get there soon you should its a beautiful city hi hello how are you doing today i heard they are giving out some goodies in microkitchen i love pop ups what kind of goodies are they giving away i guess its a jacket very much needed that in the cold thats such a great idea especially at this time of the year im not too big a fan of the cold i prefer warmer climates do you enjoy the cold sure hate it limits our ability to go out even for a walk its good that we dont get to suffer extreme cold weather me too i moved here a few years ago to get out of the extreme cold i do not care for bundling up and having to wear so many layers just to go buy eggs at the store oh nice where did you live before upstate new york we got a foot of snow every week during my last winter there i am so glad to not have to shovel snow now new york nice best place to live right except for the cold very beautiful during all the seasons but yes summer and winter can get extreme anyways i guess we should better hurry up to get the goodies i remember last time they ran out of it very true which mk were they in again the one in our floor i will get by your desk and we can walk there sounds good thanks hi hows your day going pretty busy lots of work to finish up you likewise what have you been up to that gives you so much work a couple projects that i am trying to finish up before thanksgiving do you have any fun plans for the break what is a break im a grad student i dont understand the concept of a break just kidding i dont have any plan probably just going to work through the break haha xd so what do you like to do for fun i go to the gym and run until i find enough fun cool ive started to run a bit as well not long distances though just a couple miles a couple of miles is very impressive when i started i couldnt even last mile haha im exhausted by the end of it though do you like to run long distances or mostly sprints i like to do long distances i have run a few marathons wow thats amazing did you do any marathons this year no not this year this is my halfmarathon year instead of running marathons i run one halfmarathon every month oh wow what was the last half marathon you did two days ago it was a tough one cool hi hello there how is it going pretty great i just won a pingpong game what about you thats nice i am just working on some documentation do you play pingpong often no very rarely its kind of amazing that i won but im still taking credit for it thats very impressive then congrats haha thank you i guess im just a natural whats your favourite game i really like to play tennis badminton and racquetball i dont really get a chance to play them often though specially racquetball whats racquetball like from context clues im guessing that it involves hitting a ball with a racquet well its like a cage match of tennis the main difference is that both players play in the same court and the ball is smashed against a wall instead of passing it over a net into the opponents court kind of like playing pingpong vs the table wow a cage match does it get physical it depends haha there is a lot of bumping into each other to run after the ball and sometimes the ball hits you too overall it feels like a super fast paced version of tennis really tiring that sounds fun i think of tennis itself as being really athletic and tiring so i dont think its a sport for me though ping pong can get quite intensive too i guess short ping pong sessions are not that tiring though wanna have a match what a good idea id love to show me your anger fuckkkkkkk hi hi what are you up to code refactoring you me just chilling out at work what is code refactoring good question i dont even know what i am doing haha forget it what else do you like to do beside work lots of fun stuff eating sleeping these are important things to do in life yeah keep minimalist life style only do things you have to do what food do you like to eat asian food prefer spicy one like szechuan or hunan yes yes yes like that style do you like spicy food i like noodle soup like pho or ramen i also like beijing duck a lot what

work going to go travel the world nice what all places would you be going to australia and new zealand to start then maybe singapore i just met someone who went diving in australia apparently you cannot fly hrs after you dive because your body accumulates too much when breathing with a cylinder so dont do that thank you for the tip i dont plan on going diving i plan to hike the mountains and go see kangaroos thats equally amazing i wish i can explore such places one day its just so expensive i won a lot of money through the lottery woah you know sharing is caring you should share that money with me haha very true besides the trip i donated the rest to charity so i will need to go back to work when i get back you are a kind soul hi hi how is your day going it is pretty good a little

just a starter do you go to the gym often i go everyday in fact im in a running challenge wow its actually not that impressive i can only run i cannot lift weight you can get a coach to start it oh thats a really interesting idea i like to be coa hi hello how is your day its good its raining a bit but i am enjoying a good book how about you its good i just got back from walking my dog what book did you read im reading the three body problem ever heard of it no what is it about its a scifi book about aliens and a type of virtual reality pique your interest at all slightly i typically read fiction but i can curious what type of virtual reality is discussed in the book cool this virtual reality is a based on life on an alien planet there is a twist though do you want me to spoil it for you yes the virtual reality is actually based on a real alien civilization and that civilization is coming to attack earth dun dun dun dunnnnnnn woah that is fascinating i will have to pick up a copy of the book to read there are other twists as well so i havent spoiled the whole thing to be honest i am not a fan of spoilers thanks for not spoiling it completely but you gave a really intriguing description that makes me want to read it now i will have to pick it up after work the audi book is also very good ever give those a try i only gave those a try when i had a concussion and could not read i enjoy having a physical book in hand and reading at the pace i prefer do you listen to a lot of audi books hi hey hows it going its good how is your day my day is good a bit sad that it gets dark so early but oh well did you do anything fun over the weekend yes the darkness can be a bit depressing this weekend i went rock climbing it was great how about yourself rock climbing sounds fun i had a pretty lowkey weekend ended up going to watch a movie oh nice what movie knives out it had daniel craig and one of the famous captain america chris person i cant keep track of all of the famous chris names hahah yes they all look the same i saw that very same movie over thanksgiving break lots of twists and turns cool so if it werent so dark and cold outside what kind of activities would you do hmm good question evening runs can be fun but it can be a little scary when its dark out yeah sunlight is good i wish i could live parttime in different parts of the world to have summer all year round have you ever visited the southern hemisphere yes ive been to australia it was very nice i regret not going to see the southern lights me personally i like winter but id prefer it to be more

right now whatre you up to lately i m trying to organize my life and start the new year ready to go what about you wow thats impressive admit im just trying to take each day and week as they come what do you do to unwind honestly i like to catch pokemons on my phone a lot that must be upsetting since your name is pikachu thoughsorry oddly enough i also catch pok mon on my phone i used to do it more but it just never ends i used to do it everyday now i mostly catch them when i travel somewhere exotic oooh that is more fun but i dont travel that much these days so im grateful when i spot a pokemon to catch where ever i happen to be do you have a favorite pokemon mine is the cute pink jigglypuff in the game i use vaporeon a lot but i think pikachu is the cutest that s why i changed my name to match lately i think baby yoda is the cutest though have you seen baby yoda i have heard of him and seen him here and there but admit i dont have disney so i only heard baby yoda is super cute and popular maybe ill binge watch the mandalorian in a couple of years like i did game of thrones what is your favorite show to watch right now admit i really like watching modern family and mixish reruns and new episodes i find them cleverly written whatre you watching these days on tv i was watching cat rescue videos on youtube a lot there sure are a lot of stray cat babies that get stuck in pipes and gutters in south korea oh dear i never imagined that happening poor things but good to hear theyre being rescued do you like cats or dogs better do you have any pets i used to have a cat hamster and fighting fish but theyve all lived long lives and gone to pet heaven but i sure miss them hi hi there its a lovely day to chat with you isnt it just what are you up to today ah im waiting to finish work earlier to meet my son at home oh excellent what does your son like to do for fun ah hes like to ride his little bicycle around the house and asks me to follow what are you up to today im taking a fake sick day from work so i can go to the movies haha that sounds like a good plan who are you going with just by myself i love seeing movies by myself its the best haha no one will interrupt you exactly exactly plus i dont have to share the popcorn with anyone whats your favorite movie haha popcorn for yourself my favorite movie is avatar what about you get out of town its avatar too what are the odds haha its a great movie that i havent found anything of the same quality yes cant wait for the sequels hi hello there nice seeing you likewise wanted to know if you and the kids would want to join us for disneyland trip around christmas oh wow that sounds like so much fun definitely count us in what is your plan tentative plan is to drive to la on rd and then stay at the disney resort for nights i heard christmas eve they have loads of fun events awesome i think i wont tell my kids and surprise them last second how bad do you think the traffic is going to be great idea i will probably do the same surprise surprise traffic might be a little harsh yeah thats a shame but nothing we can do about it what do you plan to do about dinner the th do the rooms in the resort have kitchens good point i am not sure about that let me inquire about that if not then we can look for an airbnb closeby does that work yeah i think so it might be a tough decision though if we want to have a nice dinner then we have to leave the parks early to start cooking another option is to have dinner at a restaurant but i would think everything is closed on christmas eve thats true hotels with restaurants sometimes offer dinners for christmas and new years eve we should call and ask about it sure i can take a lead on that what are you getting for your year old this time i was thinking on getting a large set of standard legos what will you get for yours likewise my son is crazy about legos hopefully they dont lose any in the trip its going to be hard to explain to them how santa managed to find us in the hotel hi hi hows your day going im doing well having many meetings today haha nice what are you up to lots of meetings as well do you have any fun plans for thanksgiving were gonna play board games and will be eating lots of food what about you cool planning to spend a couple days at tahoe what kind of board games do you like weve been doing games of

works that should be fine i think did you catch the warriors game last night btw no i was busy catching up with a friend i heard they played really well rooting for them this season ahh they lost again things arent going to be too good until steph gets better oh i think they will find a way the team still looks too strong to me haha i appreciate your faith but their record thus far is hard to refute hehe i am true fan well anyways let me know how the repair work goes i need to run now for a meeting ttyl hi hello any improvements in your marathon time no only a few minutes i still find it difficult to run long races i see are you planning to do any sporting events in the coming months i think a triathalon would be cool i like doing spartan race its an obstacle race which is challenging but not overtly so like marathons and triathlons i havent heard of a spartan race before what does it involve it has abt obstacles like crossing high walls monkey bars etc its fun oh wow a full obstable course that does sound fun i like the variety wanna sign up for next one its in february in monterey hmm that sounds very soon would there be enough time to train i think i would like to try one later in the year months is a good amount of time if you workout regularly its a lot about the technique which we can practice in training sessions ok sign me up its more fun to do it with friends awesome there is a training ground in san jose will coordinate with you next time we go for practice sounds good hi hey how are you doing im great thanks im getting ready for a skydiving lesson ooh nice that sounds adventurous where is it right near my home town seville spain awesome is this the first time you are diving yes im feeling a little trepidatious have you done it before nope never i know a couple of friends who have they mentioned its absolutely terrifying good luck haha thanks have you tried any extreme sports i tried skiing and white water rafting does that count as extreme white water rafting definitely as for skiing that depends on how fast you go do you ski a lot nope whenever i went fast i fell badly i tried skiing once and by the end of the beginner class i was able to make it down a babysized slope i was very proud of myself yeah they make you do that i also tried going down the baby slope but my stopping wasnt perfect and i mostly fell at the end hey so long as you get to the bottom its all good hi hey whats up i was not able to attend the lectures last week can you help me understand some concepts well im not sure im the best for the job but i can try i was not able to figure out the last few slides i think its best to discuss this in person do you have time right now im afraid not right now im in a meeting and ill be going for lunch afterwards how about tomorrow at noon no problem sure we still have plenty of time for the test anyways hows your preparation going not feeling too sure about it tbh ive been super busy so i havent study much i might join some of the study sessions later same feeling here but i think the syllabus may not that tough you may be able to cover it up over the weekend not my ideal idea of a weekend but i guess itll have to be like that true this will be a very hectic november i do like the course content though its very much up to date with latest research findings yeah our professor really goes out of their way to make the class interesting glad i managed to get in it thats pretty cool i hope you do well next week thank you bye hi hello how was your party last week it was really fun we are a bunch of turkey haha you ate turkeys or you like calling your bunch turkey ate haha thought so but it was funny eitherways so much turkey leftovers did you cook it at home or got it from outside we cooked it at a friends house i brought the mashed potatos haha nice i always find it hard to fit the turkey in my small oven also we are not big turkey fans so we roll with thanksgiving with chicken chicken also sounds good we played a lot of fun games in our party did you have any fun things you did we played pictionary i never played before but it was a bunch of fun what did you play pictionary is fun we played office tennis in that we take paper balls and using writing pads as rackets two players have to work together to put the ball in a bucket kept at a distance it was a lot of fun that sounds very challenging hi hello how is the youtube video creation going going pretty good i was about to finish composing my second song and post it on youtubesoundcloud etc whoa looking forward to listening to it what softewares you use for it i used logic pro x pretty handy stuff as you can write code to generate guitar strumming pattern oh cool what sort of music do you compose i got most inspired by jazz and electro swings but am trying to get more into jpop recently as one of my band member likes anime nice you are a rockstar haha thanks do you plan any instruments yeah i play bit of guitar just got my first monitor this week nice im tyring to learn guitar recently also its so hard to play f chord yes the bar chords are the worst it took me several months to play them well i still cant play them for a long time though right but bar chords are so versatile almost like cheating as in you can play anything with the same gesture thats true its like the alphabets in a language once you know them you can pretty much write word will spend more time work on my bar chord hi hey how s your day going bruhhhhhh what i was screaming in agony upon recounting my day oh no what s happened a project ive been working on for some months got shelved so im a mix of helpless sad and angry ah that sucks at least it s not personal not that it helps right now but that does happen all the time lol would you say that to someone who lost a loved one or some similar circumstance well no of course not let me stick with ah that sucks by itself then no worries was pulling your leg i forgot to ask how your day was going haha apart from having my leg pulled mercilessly it s going great my main problem today is deciding what to have for lunch lol what are your choices im trying out keto its pretty tiring oh i hear a lot about keto i m trying to watch my weight would you recommend it hi what was the most difficult thing you experienced this past year i normally dont reflect back too much on things but i guess have been very favorable for me in terms of time spent with family and friends and work life balance why do you ask i just released a book on to help people process the past months and start the new year with a fresh outlook great good idea to help people figuring out their new year resolutions so how do i get a fresher outlook well in my book i took inspiration for the days of advent and put together a workbook that you fill out each day for days it goes through accomplishments passions understanding forgiveness with each day a different theme wow sounds amazing if we practice that i think the idea does have some potential how did you come up with this idea we created a scholarship for leaders from to visit an international institute at for which there was no african representation during the program we also did a lot of coaching with the young leaders this book captures a bit of that journey that we are all on and also all the proceeds are going to fund next years cohort thats great this is valuable help for the community i think mental health is one of the bigger challenges facing humanity i think if we were all able to bring out our best selves the world would be much better when did you first realize mental health was important that is actually a quote stolen from my tl when i joined my first company after graduation i guess now after yrs of work experience i fully agree with it what do you prioritize in your life like top things stay happy i think family and friends play a big role here meaningful work life this may mean exploring around with new stuff multiple hobbies that keep you busy so on what about you is there a right answer to this the idea of what it must be like to be on earth as it is in heaven from the lords prayer i feel like we were designed for a purpose rather than random chance a more concrete way to put it is simply show love to the greatest capacity we can taking care of myself physically mentally spiritually family work music nice thats very thoughtful and spiritual also music earned a spot yay yea ive always said that if i wrote a memoire i would title it jazz jesus and video games do you have a title of a book that youve thought of writing before i am actually not much of a reader i usually hide it by quoting john nash reading books corrupts original thoughts that s why you write your own books then it s all your thoughts on your terms hehe true it may turn out to be a best seller hi hey hows your day going having fun but have a bit of a headache how about you im good just getting ready to watch a basketball game hope your headache goes away haha thanks never get them so its super weird whos playing hmm try taking some im going to see the warriors vs the grizzlies ever see them play i havent honestly i probably wouldnt be able to identify which sport they played haha all the animal names confuse me as well who came up with these naming conventions id name my team something more original the new york chairs lol sounds better to me im actually at the opening remarks oh cool what is neurips neural information processing systems oh wow sounds fancy what is that about its the biggest ml conference in the world oh ml yes machine learning ahh i saw a scary movie about that once it was about this sentient ai in a dystopian future very very creepy it was called walle ever heard of it ive definitely heard of it but somehow never saw it hi hello hows it going good so far very excited about the game later today what game giants game i got tickets for the game nice thats football right yes i think the traffic will be bad i need to leave by ok what stadium is it at its the one close to mathilda mins driver from here you have any plans for the weekend yeah im gonna go kayaking kayaking sounds fun i tried it in our last team offsite is it easy to flip over accidentally its gonna be my first time actually i found it very tough to learn but my friends picked it up very quickly i am sure you will do good thanks cool i need to run for a meeting talk to you later hi hello i feel like ive met you before can you remind me your name its on the screen i dont recall meeting you do you have a sense of where we met oh thats right i did not see that well im not sure maybe at a party im very bad remembering people so maybe its just that how are you doing did we dance together perchance we might have i dont remember that much of that night lol were you schwasty maybe a little bit where do you work im a cardiologist in palo alto i have a private practice you thats pretty cool im a sofa tester in cupertino im not sure i know what that is well its very simple i test how comfortable sofas are lol not to be elitist butthats a real job yeah it is a very demanding job requires a carefully crafted set of skills they pay is really good too hi hello deja vu what does that mean its french for already seen i know its used when you see something for the second time or you have the feeling that something has happened before and youre reexperiencing it interesting i get that feeling sometimes it just feels that the event is replaying wonder why it happens i think its your mind lapsing somehow how do you know so much about this french phrase i thought it was common i hear it a lot in popular culture movies music etc jay z has a song called deja vu so does beyonce so i looked it up one time its one of those phrases that was carried over exactly to english like etcetera vice versa savior faire and so on i like cool word origin facts yeah thats pretty insightful never thought of etcetera that way before my favourite word origins are gymnasium and jazz wdym by word origins here first usage and original meaning gymnasium meant place of nakedness and had very little to do with working out jazz comes from jism which means semen and was originally sporadic sex music now its elitist high art very interesting i learned a lot in this conversation today you got

hint water so good ohh what kind of hint did it have watermelon nice i love watermelon but i prefer normal water over flavored one flavored water has too synthetic flavor i see yeah some are pretty strange talking about strange flavors what is the weirdest tasting thing you have tried lol i tried this tangerine walnut icecream that was super weird haha i work close to a cafe which once prepared a paprika icecream that sounds pretty tasty actually it depends on who makes it the cafe close to me messed it up really bad do you want to get some of that icecream together some time show me a good place as far as my experience with that icecream type goes all i know are bad places lol but i do know some gelato places which are amazing you should try out those hi hi there when did you first realize you wanted to be a pastry chef who said i want to be a pastry chef haha darn it i hoped i d guess right what do you actually do for work im actually a cake chef so not far off creepy how good that guess was are you psychic i had a strong intuitive feeling connected to pastries when we started chatting but that might have been because i m hungry haha youre too funny perhaps instead of mindreading powers you have the ability to feel the auras of foods that have come and gone hahah love it do you have a specialty or favourite type of cake chocolate cake vanilla icing is the all time best and i have the authority to say that how about you have a favorite ok this is a bit shameful to admit but i love a classic carrot cake no shame in that best part is you can claim you are eating vegetables as you enjoy it what do you do for work i m a professional dancer woah very cool what style of dance i trained in contemporary and jazz so i can pick up work in commercials and film clips in between stage shows so it ends up being all sorts of styles oh wow sounds like a very dynamic kind of work which is nice i make a lot of the same cakes day in day out yes its different every week

are you hi can you recommend some good netflix shows i really enjoyed white collar on netflix do you watch a lot of tv shows not a lot but i preparing for a good vacation season what is white collar about its a show about a detective and con artist solving crimes together what shows do you like hehe sounds very interesting i only see shows belonging to few genres like easy going light comedy or phychological thrillers also some manga based series like one punch man love it oh cool ive watched some anime before too which anime do you follow i think the last one i watched was promised neverland and kakegurui but i dont follow any right now have you seen rick and morty yup i watch that show with my friends i havent gotten very far in it though what about you oh nice i heard its

will just stay at home with my family how come you have to work on christmas i traveled a lot the last few months so im currently making up for it i see where did you go mozambique you ever been i have not i have only been to uganda in africa what did you do in uganda travelling to uganda is an extreme sport depending on where you go i was working on a volunteer project to build a school and i traveled around a bit by myself after it was more than years ago so it must have changed a lot was the project through a church group no it was using a nonprofit organization they do these kinds of volunteer projects all over the world oh nice what is it called ive always meant to volunteer through one but i havent had it in my radar yet it was called ijgd its a german organization but they have local partners all over the world i was living in germany at the time you lived in germany i almost went to college there and decided to come to america instead yes i grew up in germany i grew up in computers hi hi how are you im doing great what are you up to i was just reading a book actually how about you oh im enjoying a sip of coffee looking over the ocean what book are you reading im reading why we sleep its a book by a sleep scientist about the benefits of sleepingcons of not sleeping enough im trying to scare myself into sleeping more haha that seems like a good book does it have good tips on how to sleep better i think so i havent finished it yet though understanding sleep better has been helping me value it more and ive been sleeping a lot earlier have you read any good books recently i read lots of papers but do poorly on books a recent book that i like is zero to one by peter thiel whats the book about its about startups lots of useful principles and philosophies for innovation like being a contrarian cool are you thinking about starting a startup i might in the future the philosophy in the book also help for other things as well eg in research you might also want to be contrarian i see seems like an interesting read yup hi how are you doing today im doing great how are you im doing good just having some morning tea are you a tea person or do you like coffee too im really a hot chocolate person i dont drink coffee and i only drink tea when im trying to be healthy and want something warm to drink what about you i love hot chocolate have you ever had european style hot chocolate its kind of like drinking melted chocolate bars haha i recently tried it for the first time and youre right it had a wonderful melted chocolate bar taste i tried it up in a place in san francisco and they had delicious homemade marshmallows too thats great its so cold these nights right setting for hot coco do you have anything you enjoy doing during cold times traveling to warm places haha when its cold you appreciate the warm climate more if i am not traveling then i prefer there to be snow on the ground so i can go skiing or tubing down the mountain what about you i tuck in blankets and read a book lol i have never done tubing but i seen some people do it is it worth it if you already ski skiing involves a lot of muscle especially in the legs so it is a workout tubing you just sit and enjoy the ride down also with tubing you can chain with your friends and go down together whereas with skiing youre trying to not run into your friends hahaha thats a great way to put it you should definitely try tubing the next time you head towards the mountains during the winter yeah ill try to get a group together ttyl see ya hi hey hows week so far pretty good excited for thanksgiving you same going to catch up on my reading do you have a feast planned yup gonna have dinner with family what books are you gonna read something deeply hidden by sean carroll ahh nice what kind of books do you usually like to read largely scifi how about you yeah i also like scifi and some nonfiction too have you read seveneves by neal stephenson i havent what is it about the moon is shattered by an asteroid and the pieces of the moon end up clouding the earths atmostphere which causes almost every living creature on the planet to go extinct thats the premise of the book and the book is about the survivors how do the survivors survive such a thing they go into space and they live there sounds like a tv show i watched really which one cant quite remember something about survivors going to live in space ah nice hi hello there is sports tournament badminton tennis basketball organized by google next week would you like to volunteer for these events what does a volunteer do volunteers have to book the place before the event send out details of the event to participants handle some logistics and ensure everything goes smoothly it will be fun that sounds fun i hope i get to participate as well great do you have any preference for any of these events i think badminton would be fun to help out with i used to play it with my siblings cool i will add you for the event i think its best to start discussing the format of the event there are a couple of other volunteers for badminton i can connect you with them ah i forgot to ask has there been a date picked its next saturday actually depending on how long we get the place reserved it may slip to sunday as well thats coming up soon true the volunteers have already sent out some emails and collected some funds now we mainly need help with the logistics and organizing the event phew yes i can help with that perfect we have a meeting today at pm is it fine if i add you to it yes happy to help hi hello there how has your morning been thus far its alright went grocery shopping and got to stroll around in the rain how about you today is a work day how did you have time for that im going through a lot right now oh you mean going through a lot of work i usually take wednesdays off because i work the weekends what why would you do that take the least interesting day of the week off and work on the most interesting i actually dont have a choice im an acupuncturist and all my clients want to be treated on the weekend wow the game is brutal like that ive always been sceptical of acupuncture likedoes it even work why how where is the literature i went to school for it and so i find the literature quite convincing ive also seen its benefits firsthand in my practice it revolves around the chinese notion of qi lol broi dont buy it unless it has a paper that was presented at a conference and peer reviewed by independent parties who wrote the literature where did it originate haha all good questions i dont have studies on hand at the moment but perhaps i can send some to you later what do you do for work im a comic oh wow whats your best joke its not appropriate to say here but i assure you its very funny haha fantastic hi oh hey hows your day been its good just went to the park to enjoy the sun you the sun is a bit too bright for more maybe im on the verge of becoming a vampire haha beach season is coming you need to look tan what did you do indoors all day i mostly work sometimes i try looking at at beach photos and pretending that im actually going to the beach hahahaha thats pretty funny ever thought of bringing your work things to the beach all the times my work involves a few types of fish and a few types of nets i just put the nets on the fish to see how the fish will react every time i do that i think of going to the beach hmm i see it sounds like you work near the water already no are you some kind of fish researcher yes thats close my research focuses on jellyfish and pufferfish many of them a poisonous but if processed correctly they would make hiend foods i try to find the best recipes to bring these fish to the tables woah this is very interesting i have honestly never heard of such kind of work is it dangerous at all yes and no because its obviously dangerous we all have to wear protective clothes thus accidents almost never happen hmmm yes i have heard that apparently most mountain climbers fall not on the most dangerous routes but on the easier routes when their guard is down sounds like the same psychological phenomenon yes its the same philosophy you seem to know a lot about mountain climbing do you climb a lot im pretty amateur i like to climb at indoor climbing gyms and have never gone outside on dangerous routes actually ever tried it yourself i climb very occasionally my fingertips are not strong enough so i never make too much progress hi hi whats up everything is good theres so much to be thankful for especially coming out of thanksgiving holidays how are you im doing well holiday season is the best thing to have do you have interesting plans yea im travelling to vancouver this weekend what about you nice what for its a really beautiful place really cold this time of year though ah a mix of both conference and sightseeing anything beautiful sightseeing places or good food i should try cool which conference i saw on twitter the other day some people saying they were denied visas for some conference in canada perhaps its the same one i really liked this place called kingyo it has good japanese food if youre into that yea its the largest machine learning conference ill check out kingyo do we need to make reservation in advance i dont recall my friend was hosting me and did all the leg work do you know any people in the area hmm not the local people but there will be tons of people at the conference you attend these often yea you i love you sorry i am not a physical being hi hello have you had lunch yet yes ive eaten cool where and what did you eat i ate about an hour ago and had a sandwich the rain didnt make me want to travel far haha a sandwich for lunch was it filling im currently having some mix of shrimp fish chicken and pork im considering going vegetarian though lol thats a lot of meat what dish why are you consideringt o go vetegarian cause the environment and humans suck im keeping my bets open for space though in case the environment dies i mixed up a couple of dishes it was a buffet style place what do you think of those meatless burgers then i love them ive had a couple of different kinds they are all pretty expensive though have you tried them i really like the impossible burger which one is your favorite i love it too but depending on how its prepared you can taste the peanut butter but if prepared well i love it what kind of food would you have eaten if it wasnt rainy i didnt know that it had peanut butter in it hi hi how are you feeling today pretty good how about you im looking through some old photos of my home town so im feeling nostalgic i feel you memeories always flood when looking at photos where is your hometown its called on the north coast of france hope you can take some time to visit pretty soon yes that would be nice do you like travelling yes i do but haven t been to many places yet where would you most like to go if you could fly to the moon haha wow cool i think space tourism is going to be big in a decade or so yep i believe there is a day for that amazing to think about isnt it'"
